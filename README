Instructions:

1.	First, start the zookeeper in myzk directory:
	$ bin/zkServer.sh start
	*	To continue we need to know <zk's ip> which is the ip of the machine the zookeeper is running on,
		and also <zk's port> which is the port of the zookeeper which can be found by running below in
		myzk directory:
	$ cat conf/zoo.cfg

2.	Start the Job Tracker:
	$ ./FileServer.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port> <my port>

3.	Start the File Server:
	$ ./FileServer.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port> <my port> <dictionary file>

4.	Start the Worker:
	$ ./FileServer.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port>

5.	Finally, start the Client Driver:
