Instructions:

1.	First, start the zookeeper in myzk directory:
	$ bin/zkServer.sh start
	*	To continue we need to know <zk's ip> which is the ip of the machine the zookeeper is running on,
		and also <zk's port> which is the port of the zookeeper which can be found by running below in
		myzk directory:
	$ cat conf/zoo.cfg

2.	Start the Job Tracker:
	$ ./JobTracker.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port> <my port>
	*	Do above TWICE.

3.	Start the File Server:
	$ ./FileServer.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port> <my port> <dictionary file>
	*	Do above TWICE.

4.	Start the Worker:
	$ ./Worker.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port>
	*	You can start as many workers as you like but not more than 266 (for more details look at our design
		decision).

5.	Finally, start the Client Driver:
	$ ./ClientDriver.sh <zk's ip>:<zk's port>
	
	*	Following this, there will be a simple user interface to let the client to choose to submit a cracking
		request or to query the status of the request submitted.
